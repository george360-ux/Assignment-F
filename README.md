# U.S. Strawberry Production, Organic Vs. Conventinal by State: Fertilizer Use

The project analyzes US strawberry production using USDA agricultural data, with a focus on:

-   Conventional vs. organic strawberry farming across different states

-   Fertilizer application patterns across states and years

-   Cleaning and tidying USDA survey and census datasets

-   Identifying trends in nitrogen, phosphate, potash and sulfur use

The goal is to understand agricultural practices in strawberry production and explore differences that align with conventional vs. organic systems.

## Objectives

1.  Build a clean and analysis ready dataset from a raw USDA public data

2.  Compare production reporting from USDA survery vs. census programs

3.  Create visuals for analyzing fertilizer use metrics

4.  Explore indicators of orgnaic vs. conventional practices

## Key Methods

-   Remove single value columns

-   Convert numeric strings to a numeric format

-   Split survey and census to properly preprocess variables

-   Pivot long to wide format or panel structure

## Analyses Performed

-   Descriptive summaries of fertilizer use

-   State-level fertilizer comparisons

-   Fertilizer trends over the years

The skills learned to complete the final report were data cleaning and wrangling using R packages (dplytr, stringr, tidyverse, data.table). Government data formats can also be messy and this project reflects on what statisticians work with when giving a data set that needs to be organization in order to begin the analysis.
