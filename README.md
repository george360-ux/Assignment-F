# U.S. Strawberry Production, Organic Vs. Conventional by State: Fertilizer Use

The project analyzes US strawberry production using USDA agricultural data, with a focus on:

-   Conventional vs. organic strawberry farming across different states

-   Fertilizer application patterns across states and years

-   Cleaning and tidying USDA survey and census datasets

-   Identifying trends in nitrogen, phosphate, potash, and sulfur use

The goal is to understand agricultural practices in strawberry production and explore the differences between conventional and organic systems.

## Objectives

1.  Build a clean and analysis ready dataset from the raw USDA public data

2.  Compare production reporting from the USDA survey vs. census programs

3.  Create visuals for analyzing fertilizer use metrics

4.  Explore indicators of organic vs. conventional practices

## Key Methods

-   Remove single-value columns

-   Convert numeric strings to a numeric format

-   Split survey and census to properly preprocess variables

-   Pivot long to wide format or panel structure

## Analyses Performed

-   Descriptive summaries of fertilizer use

-   State-level fertilizer comparisons

-   Fertilizer trends over the years

The skills learned to complete the final report were data cleaning and wrangling using R packages (dplytr, stringr, tidyverse, data.table). Government data formats can also be messy, and this project reflects on what statisticians work with when giving a data set that needs to be organized to begin the analysis.
